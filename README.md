# UNP-Project_BI-with-Power-BI_Human-Resource
Completed this project as a part of my BI with PowerBI internship with UNP. It provides a data visualisation showing the impact of several factors on attrition based on HR Data. To clarify the same, we have designed a dashboard with a variety of slicers, cards, and charts.


key hightlights:

Studying attrition by education, commuting, experience, gender, salary, departments, job satisfaction, and work-life balance helps reduce turnover. 

Tailor strategies, address commuting, and intervene by experience. Understand gender-based attrition for diversity and connect salary to turnover for compensation insights.

Identify high-turnover departments for targeted improvements. Improve job satisfaction and work-life balance for overall well-being.
